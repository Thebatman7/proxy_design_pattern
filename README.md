# Proxy Design Pattern

This repository contains code that uses the proxy design pattern. A proxy object hides the original object and control access to it. We can use proxy when we may want to use a class that can perform as an interface to something else.
Proxy is heavily used to implement lazy loading related usecases where we do not want to create full object until it is actually needed.
A proxy can be used to add an additional security layer around the original object as well.
